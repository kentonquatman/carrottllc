<section id="about">
  <article>
    <p><span>Our clients</span> trust us to help them find and select their leaders, even advising boards on CEO succession as at Rock-Tenn last year. That trust results from a history of objectivity, integrity and superb execution. As a result, we have deep relationships with our clients and works at multiple levels and in multiple ways. If an engagement is important to a client, it's important to us.</p>
    <p>Consultants must measure their performance by the success of their clients, and the CEOs that we have helped public companies recruit have produced returns to shareholders that average 6.3 percent greater than the S&amp;P 500 each year during their tenures.</p>
    <p>In contrast, Forbes magazine reported companies that recruited a CEO using one of the four major search firms underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by three percentage points over 10 years.</p>

    <h1>Client Benefits</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Clients can make more disciplined decisions, and hence, better decisions about talent. Our team has some of the most respected advisors on talent anywhere with access to companies, boards and managements around the world, and it brings together decades of experience and a proprietary assessment methodology to solve client problems.</p>
      <p>We offer clients facts, not opinions, and use data to frame decisions. The judgments we take on people or companies can be validated. It is the strength of the data we provide; it is the precision of our process that allows clients to make optimal decisions about talent. For example, our assessment protocol allows us to predict the fit of an individual with the culture of an organization and its style of decision making with statistical validity.</p>

          <p>Líders has worked with Deere for more than 20 years. It has been involved in the recruitment of every new director to the board of Deere since 2001, for example, save one, including the election of Greg Page, the chairman of Cargill, in May 2013.</p>

            <p>There’s a real chemistry that comes from picking the right people. What's also helped us is using a search firm for quite a while now that really has a good understanding of board chemistry.</p>
            <p>And so, as we vet candidates, they are not individuals who people personally knew...The search consultant knows our board,  knows our company and was able to say whether the chemistry of this individual would or would not fit in.</p>
            <p>We still then go through the process of interviewing the individual  and making up our own minds, but the search consultant helps us really refine the candidate pool.</p>

        <h2>Exelon Corporation</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Exelon is among the largest utilities in the United States thanks to its merger with Constellation Energy.</p>
          <p>Líders' involvement with Exelon began with a conversation with John Rowe, then the chairman and CEO of Exelon. The topic was a succession plan for a larger, more diverse utility. Mr. Rowe saw the opportunity to create value for shareholders through a merger or acquisition, and at the time, neither he nor the board saw clear internal succession possibilities.</p>
          <p>Exelon identified eight potential acquisitions, including Constellation, and a dozen of the companies’ executives, and asked Líders to assess the executives as candidates to become chief executive of a merged company. Líders prepared reports based upon firsthand knowledge of the "candidates," third-party research and references. The references included former employees and directors, bankers, analysts and regulators. The number of executives expanded over time as Exelon considered more options. No confidence was ever breeched.</p>
          <p>Christopher Crane from Exelon became the chief executive of Exelon with the merger, and  Constellation’s chairman and chief executive Mayo Shattuck became the chairman of the Exelon board.</p>

          <p>Nash Finch was the second largest publicly traded grocery wholesaler even before its merger with Spartan Stores last November. Ron Marshall had been its CEO for seven years when he announced his resignation. Líders had placed him.</p>
          <p>The board retained Líders, again, to conduct the search for a new CEO. As Líders began to interview directors, however, the board split over corporate direction. Half favored continued acquisitions; half favored operational excellence and no more acquisitions. Líders facilitated the discussions in which the board reached consensus around operational excellence as the most likely avenue for developing shareholder value. This led to the recruitment of Alec Covington as CEO through Líders.</p>
          <p>Líders recruited five directors to the board of Nash Finch, including, most recently, Chris Bodine, the retired executive vice-president of marketing and merchandising at CVS Caremark. In addition, Líders conducted two consulting engagements for the board.</p>

        <h2>Snap-on Incorporated</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Snap-on may best be known for its iconic hand tools, but the company has greatly changed its position in the marketplace through acquisitions that make lifts and diagnostic equipment for vehicle-repair shops, and software for managing parts and repair shops themselves.</p>
          <p>When the CEO who had overseen the acquisitions retired, the board conducted an ill-fated search. The new CEO lasted only a few years before the board terminated him, and board member Jack Michaels, who had just retired as the CEO of HNI Corporation, stepped into the role.</p>
          <p>Mr. Michaels brought order and discipline to Snap-on and began the development of possible successors. When he announced his retirement, however, the board still had questions about internal candidates. It launched another search, this time using Líders.</p>
          <p>Líders presented four external candidates, one from the U.K. and two who have since become the CEOs of other public companies, along with assessing the three internal candidates. The search quickly became due diligence for the board as an internal candidate, Nick Pinchuk, emerged and became COO, then CEO.</p>
          <p>Mr. Pinchuk has re-jiggered Snap-on’s franchise business, triggering growth in the United States and overseas. He has linked the acquisitions into integrated offerings for car-repair shops and dealerships. Profits and cash flow have increased, and the shares of Snap-on have almost tripled since Mr. Pinchuk became CEO.</p>
          <p>Líders subsequently recruited Jim Holden, the former president-CEO of DaimlerChrysler Corporation, and Gregg Sherrill, chairman and CEO of Tenneco Incorporated, to the Snap-on board.</p>
